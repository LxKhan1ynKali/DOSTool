⚔️ Authorized Network Stress & Resilience Testing Framework
Overview
This repository contains a collection of network traffic generation, stress testing, and simulation tools intended strictly for authorized security testing, research, and defensive validation.
The purpose of these tools is to help Red Teams emulate real-world attack conditions and Blue Teams evaluate detection, mitigation, alerting, and incident response capabilities under controlled environments.
🚫 Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.
Intended Use Cases
Red Team attack surface simulation
Blue Team SOC readiness & alert validation
Network resilience and rate-limiting tests
DDoS detection & mitigation verification
IDS / IPS / WAF behavior analysis
Incident response tabletop & live-fire exercises
Academic and lab-based security research
Authorization Policy
These tools MUST ONLY be used when at least one of the following applies:
You own the target infrastructure
You have explicit written permission from the system owner
The activity is conducted inside:
Private lab
CTF environment
Isolated test network
Authorized penetration testing scope
Any misuse outside authorized scope is not supported, encouraged, or condoned.
Red Team Notes
Designed to emulate realistic traffic patterns
Useful for validating:
